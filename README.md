# NotifyBalloon
an implementation of a basic notify balloon

I started this project when I needed to use NotifyIcon.ShowBalloonTip() method, but wasn't satisfied with it. Most annoying part with the NotifyIcon approach was even if there is a `timeout` parameter on the `.ShowBalloonTip()` method, it wasn't doing anything. It is a deprecated parameter it says deep inside of msdn documentations jungles.

This is the first project I decided to put into public GitHub repositories and unfortunately was a rushed project. So you are encouraged to put your work in it, develop this component in all ways, and help the ones who are suffering from the same insanity.
